# OpenConext Virtual Machine

These are the source files to build an OpenConext Virtual Machine.

# Requirements for building the OpenConext VM (in order)

* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [RVM](https://rvm.io/)
* [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* Patience (a full build, depending on your network connection, should take about 4 hours)

# Installation

First install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) if you have not done already. 

The OpenConext Virtual Machines scripts uses [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and [VeeWee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee) for building up the VM. You don't have to install these dependencies as we use [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) to install gems in the local gemset (to avoid polluting your global applications and/ or gemset).

To use Ruby and use local gemsets we first need to install [RVM](https://rvm.io//rvm/install/) using:

    curl https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer | bash -s stable

Now we can install the latests Ruby version:

    rvm install 1.9.3
    rvm --default use 1.9.3

Verify the correct installation by typing:

    ruby -v

You should see:

    ruby 1.9.3p0 (2011-10-30 revision 33570) [x86_64-darwin10.8.0]

Now get the source code of the  OpenConext VM:

    $ git clone git://github.com/OpenConext/OpenConext-vm.git
    $ cd OpenConext-vm
    
Now you are prompted to accept the OpenConext .rvmrc file:

    RVM has encountered a new or modified .rvmrc file in the current directory =
    This is a shell script and therefore may contain any shell commands.       =

    Examine the contents of this file carefully to be sure the contents are    =
    safe before trusting it! ( Choose v[iew] below to view the contents )      =

    Do you wish to trust this .rvmrc file? (/path/OpenConext-vm/.rvmrc)
    y[es], n[o], v[iew], c[ancel]>

Accept the .rmvrc file by typing **y**

Now install bundler as local gem:

    $ gem install bundler

And use the gems defined in the Gemfile to install vagrant and veewee:

    $ bundle install

Verify that Vagrant and VeeWee are setup correctly with the following commands (should not return an error):

    $ vagrant -v
    $ vagrant basebox templates

Then build a basebox (one time):

    $ vagrant basebox build -f demo.openconext.org &&
    $ vagrant basebox export demo.openconext.org &&
    $ vagrant box remove demo.openconext.org
    $ vagrant box add demo.openconext.org demo.openconext.org.box

Then instantiate the box:

    $ vagrant destroy
    $ vagrant up

Finally copy host/hosts to your [hosts file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29)
and point your browser to <https://profile.demo.openconext.local>.

# Usage

You can now use the following OpenConext components:
